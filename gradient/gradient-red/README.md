# Gradient Red - VistaPanel Theme
A gradient red theme for VistaPanel.

## Installation
Download the theme you like and upload the files to your website.

If you don't want to host the files on your server yourself or you can't host them, check below.

### Use our CDN
You can always use our free CDN if you cannot host the files on your server, it's really fast :)
NeotiDev's CDN domain is `cdn.neotidev.cf`. You can also use `cdn.vpthemes.win`

### How to upload it on VistaPanel
Go to the [MOFH Reseller Panel](https://panel.myownfreehost.net), Your Adverts -> Control Panel Advert Control -> Select your domain

Then, add the following code to the `Bottom adverts` section:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.neotidev.cf/themes/reddish/icon_spritemap.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.neotidev.cf/themes/reddish/styles.css">
```
(You can also change the address to your website, if you have uploaded it on your own server)

### My theme does not appear. What can I do to fix this?
Don't forget that you need to logout and re-login to your cPanel for the changes to take effect.  
If you can't see the changes, you may need to purge your cache or try visiting the website an incognito tab.
